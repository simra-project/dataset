# Important!
due to GitHub storage constraints, we upload the majority of the data to DepositOnce and keep the more recent ride and profile data here on GitHub.

# SimRa Dataset

This project is part of the SimRa research project which includes the following subprojects:
- [sirma-android](https://github.com/simra-project/simra-android/): The SimRa app for Android.
- [simra-ios](https://github.com/simra-project/simra-ios): The SimRa app for iOS.
- [backend](https://github.com/simra-project/backend): The SimRa backend software.
- [dataset](https://github.com/simra-project/dataset): Result data from the SimRa project.
- [screenshots](https://github.com/simra-project/screenshots): Screenshots of both the iOS and Android app.
- [SimRa-Visualization](https://github.com/simra-project/SimRa-Visualization): Web application for visualizing the dataset.

In this project, we collect – with a strong focus on data protection and privacy – data on such near crashes to identify when and where bicyclists are especially at risk. We also aim to identify the main routes of bicycle traffic in Berlin. To obtain such data, we have developed a smartphone app that uses GPS information to track routes of bicyclists and the built-in acceleration sensors to pre-categorize near crashes. After their trip, users are asked to annotate and upload the collected data, pseudonymized per trip.
For more information see [our website](https://www.digital-future.berlin/en/research/projects/simra/).

The data from 06/2019 - 12/2020 can be found at https://doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-10605

3. When you make this data set publicly accessible (either in original or adapted form) you must assert that your data copy also complies with these terms of use. For this, you can either use comparable terms of use or take technical measures such as data aggregation to assert the same outcome.

# Instructions
Each file has the information of app version number and file version number as it's first line. File version number indicates how often a ride has been 
uploaded or edited: <app version>#<file version>

The "Rides" folder contains the rides and the annotations of the incidents, that were detected by the app or added by the user. In a file, first the incident information are listed, followed by an empty line, followed by "=========================", followed by the the ride information.
